# ⚡ EV Evolution: Tracking Electric Vehicle Adoption Trends

A full-stack **Data Science + Business Intelligence** project exploring electric vehicle (EV) adoption in the U.S., using **Machine Learning**, **Power BI dashboards**, and a custom **frontend website**.

---

## 🚀 Overview

This project aims to uncover the **adoption patterns of Electric Vehicles (EVs)** using real-world data. It combines **predictive analytics**, **geospatial analysis**, and **BI visualizations** to inform decisions for manufacturers, consumers, and policymakers.

🔍 Key Goals:
- Understand EV trends over time and across regions
- Predict CAFV eligibility and MSRP using ML
- Provide interactive, filterable dashboards
- Deploy insights through a secure frontend website

## 🤖 Machine Learning

We used ML models to:
- Predict MSRP (price) of EVs
- Classify CAFV eligibility
- Segment EV types and regions using clustering

| Model Type     | Algorithms Used                         |
|----------------|------------------------------------------|
| Regression     | Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost|
| Classification | Logistic Regression, SVM, XGBoost        |
| Clustering     | K-Means, DBSCAN, Hierarchical            |

> 🔍 Best Results:
- **XGBoost Regressor** (Price Prediction)
- **XGBoost Classifier** (CAFV Eligibility)
